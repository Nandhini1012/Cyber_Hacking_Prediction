# Cyber Hacking Breaching Prediction and Detection Using Machine Learning  

This project leverages **machine learning techniques**, specifically **SARIMAX modeling**, to predict and detect cybercrime breaches. It aims to provide organizations with proactive insights to mitigate cybersecurity risks and allocate resources efficiently.  

## Features  
- **Time Series Analysis**: Predict future cybercrime breaches using historical data.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, feature engineering, and anomaly detection for accurate modeling.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Optimized the model with metrics like **AIC, MSE, and RMSE**.  
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Scalable and adaptable to diverse organizational needs.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy  
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib  
  - **Time Series Modeling**: Statsmodels  

## System Overview  

### Workflow  
1. **Data Acquisition**: Collected historical breach data from reliable sources.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.  
3. **Time Series Analysis**:  
   - Used SARIMAX modeling to identify patterns and trends.  
   - Evaluated model accuracy using **AIC, MSE, and RMSE**.  
4. **Forecasting**: Predicted future breach occurrences for informed decision-making.
